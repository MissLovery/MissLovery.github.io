Hi, I'm **Zheng Ziyin（郑子吟）**, an internet product manager with a passion for life. Here in my secret base, I mainly share everything I love, which encompasses work and life. Currently, I lead the product team in a startup.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Xi'an, the ancient capital known for its rich history of thirteen dynasties, at Xidian University, a place that champions the values of "Integrity, Truth-seeking, Study, and Practice." After graduation, I bravely headed to Beijing, filled with earnest passion, and became a product manager at Qunar.com's Car Service Division. Initially, I was involved in marketing-related products, and later, I took on the responsibility for user-focused products.

In the middle of 2017, I came to the beautiful ancient capital of the Six Dynasties, Nanjing, and decided to make it my home. I joined a startup team, aspiring to make a significant impact. I rapidly progressed from a product manager responsible for a single module to the leader of a product team. Concurrently, I encountered some challenges in management. To overcome these, I pursued an MBA at Southeast University, which is known for its ethos of "Striving for Excellence."

Our team has been deeply invested in the "community group buying" sector. In early 2018, we launched "Xiao Mei Xian Sheng," a community group buying initiative in Nanjing that reached over 200 neighborhoods. While expanding the backend supply chain, we collaborated with Yun Chu Yi Zhan to develop "Yun Chu Xiao Zhan," an unmanned smart retail cabinet using RFID technology. "Yun Chu Yi Zhan" has more than 200 community stores in Nanjing, and the "Yun Chu Xiao Zhan" cabinets complement these stores by reaching areas beyond their coverage. They serve as a traffic gateway and extend our community group buying business, creating an integrated online and offline community retail ecosystem. At its peak, we installed over 50 "Yun Chu Xiao Zhan" smart retail cabinets in various locations, including universities, subway stations, and office buildings.

Currently, in the community group buying market, besides a few large enterprises, there are regional channel distributors with stable community group leader resources. They carefully select products for group leaders to sell. Our team has shifted from managing the entire community group buying chain to focusing solely on the supply chain module. We act as a supply chain company, connecting with suppliers downstream and providing goods to regional group buying channel distributors upstream. During our business operations, we identified IT needs and developed a SaaS system for community group buying supply chain companies, linking channel distributors and suppliers. 

With the rapid advancement of AI, I am continually learning how to transition into an AI product manager and how to effectively integrate AI into my daily work.

Besides work, I am a culturally inclined young woman who enjoys dancing, playing the violin, and the piano. A good understanding of life allows for better work. I maintain a passion for life, always keep an open mind, and never stop learning.
